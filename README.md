DSAN 5200 - Data Visualization Final Project

According to the American Civil Liberties Union, over 65 percent of incarcerated people are forced to work while in prison, a practice commonly known as captive labor. The Bureau of Labor Statics states that, as of 2022, approximately 1.2 million people were in prison, creating a captive labor population of around 780,000. People in prisons involved in captive labor often have less protections than workers on the outside, and they often make cents on the dollar compared to legal minimum wages.

Studying this phenomena in America can help us better understand what role captive labor plays in the US prison system. We want to use prison labor data because questions regarding criminality and the rights of the incarcerated have been brought to the forefront of national debate, especially regarding migrant detention in the United States.

We chose to merge two datasets to complete this project: the United Statesâ€™ Bureau of Justice Statistics Survey of Prison Inmates (2016) and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) publication titled Captive Labor: Exploitation of Incarcerated Workers (2022). These two datasets provided extensive information on a number of critical variables for our project, including a wealth of information in the Survey of Prison Inmates about each individual inmate, from their family situation growing up to their most recent disciplinary action while in prison, supplemented by aggregated pay data from the ACLU report.

Our data provides more than 2000 dimensions for this data, as well as geographic diversity by state across the United States. This variety allowed us to derive compelling visualizations represented throughout this project.

We would like to explore patterns of labor in the US justice system for individual inmates and at the state level. Part of this includes determining which demographics of inmates end up performing different types of work, and at what level of pay. We also would like to see how work assignments impact the lives of people in prisons around the US and if it differs by demographics or geographic area.
